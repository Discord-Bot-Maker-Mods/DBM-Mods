**Do not forget that this gives Bot Owner status according to DBM (as in access to anything set as *Bot Owner Only*)**

Insert the desired owner's Discord ID, It **MUST** be the Discord ID, not the name of the user 
(Right click -> Copy ID on the user's name with developer mode enabled) 
Once you click the + in the extension to add the ID, you may close the extension and restart your bot. 

If you do not restart your bot after doing this, the user will not have Bot Owner status until you have restarted the bot.
